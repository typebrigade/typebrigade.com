# Type Brigade №20

The Vancouver Typography Meetup Group [has been renamed](introducing-type-brigade) to __Type Brigade__. This is a refocusing, so the previous event numbering will stay in place.

Type Brigade #20’s speakers are two individuals that always surprise me with new information: Celeste Martin and Neil Kandalgaonkar.

First we’ll hear from __[Celeste Martin](#)__, the Assistant Professor in the faculty of Design + Dynamic Media at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Celeste is the editor of _Current_, the university’s award-winning design journal, and her current research focuses on ebooks.

Our second speaker will be __[Neil Kandalgaonkar](https://twitter.com/flipzagging)__. Though Neil has worked for Flikr, Google, and has since gone out on his own, he somehow managed to fit type design into his skillset along the way. He’ll be speaking about refocusing the visual conventions of Cherokee type design.

__Type Brigade #20__ will be on [June 23rd] at [Mobify HQ](#), one floor below where _The Elements of Typographic Style_ author Robert Bringhurst allegedly wrote—or so I have been told. [Register for Type Brigade here.](#)
