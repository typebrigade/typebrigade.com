There has been some necessary discussion about the lack of women speaking at TypeCon this year. Elizabeth Carey Smith noted that there was a lack of concrete ideas about where to go next:

I appreciate what Elizabeth has been saying, and hope other people—particularly women or other people that feel under-represented—continue to voice their concerns. I feel my only place in this discussion is to say what we have been trying at Type Brigade; my interest is in facilitating actual improvements at Type Br

The subject was really important to me when I started organising Vancouver’s typography and type design meetup just over a year ago; we wanted to create an event that welcomed people who were excited about type—whether they considered themselves designers or not—and host anyone from local speakers, perhaps even giving their first talk, to experienced typographers and type designers who were visiting from out-of-town.

Ashe Dryden’s writing has been very influential on me as we continue to strive for a diverse speaker lineup.


, but I have tried to incorporate other people’s successful procedures into how we run Type Brigade, Vancovuer’s typography and type design meetup.

I Ashe Dryden points 

> white, abled, straight or straight [passing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(sociology), [cisgender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender) men who speak english as their first language and grew up with technology or have been programming for a long time

Of course, diversity doesn’t just include gender. As Ashe Dryden write

## Finding Speakers

_Finding_ speakers is a more accurate title than _selecting_ speakers, because Type Brigade has yet to turn away a speaker. Our format as a free, recurring meetup, rather than an annual paid conference obviously puts us in a different position that TypeCon, but perhaps this overview will still prove valuable or at least document how we have been doing things.

We do both have an open call for proposals, but truly we have had to invite all but one person we wanted to speak. We try and compensate for our own basis while doing this. Working as a designer and developer, I am much more likely to “happen to know” white, male programmers and designers. Often times, it would be more convenient to invite them to speak. I do my best to be conscious of this and actively ask people who would be less likely to submit talks. This has resulted in some of best talks about what type means to some , too.

1. we actively try and compensate for who this bias traditionally encourages by consciously inviting speakers who might not otherwise submit.

During our first year, every event save one had one of our two talks presented by a women (sometimes two).

## Have (and use) a Code of Conduct

Since I took over organising Type Brigade, we’ve had a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) in place. I’ll defer, again, to Ashe Dryden for [many more details on why this is valuable for an event to have](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq). A Code of Conduct is

> a policy statement issued by an organization. To be considered an adequate code of conduct, it must have four complete parts:

> - statement of unacceptable behavior
> - how the policy will be enforced
> - how and whom to make an incident report to
> - training and reference materials for organizers, staff, and volunteers on how to respond to incident reports

We have all these points covered to some degree, but we could be doing a much better job of all of them, particularly the later three points.

<figcaption>We talk about our Code of Conduct at the beginning of every event. Over time, I have tried to get more explicit about what that means and our community goals.</figcaption>
</figure>

I am trying to set a better example by being more explicit about what our Code of Conduct is. <q>Be kind to others, don’t be a jerk,</q> is a nice summary but it isn’t explicit enough. I’ve started also saying:

> Something that’s very important to us is our Code of Conduct. As a design-centred event, the importance of empathy, perception and effective communication will be familiar to many attendees. We ask you keep those skills in mind here to help us create a professional and welcoming atmosphere at Type Brigade.

> We have summarise our code of conduct as “Be kind to others, and don't be a jerk,” but to be more explicit, it means we don’t tolerate any harassment or exclusionary expectations about who should or shouldn’t be here.

> The full version on the site, it applies to all speakers, attendees, sponsors, and organisers and you can make suggestions to how we should keep improving it [on the site at typebrigade.com](http://typebrigade.com/code-of-conduct) if you have any suggestions to make it better.

> If you have any concerns at all this evening, we take them very seriously. Please speak directly to Andrea, Alanna, or me, or email any one of us to bring something up. Our emails are our first name at type brigade.com.

Alanna and Andrea have always been part of this process because I’m aware if someone does have a problem (potentially even with how I handled something as an <abbr>MC</abbr>) they might not feel comfortable talking to me.

We could have a much more formal process for this, though. I basically get no messages about problems, but it would be ignorant to assume that means there are none.

Instead, we are going to try and improve our reporting process. At our next event, we will be beta testing the SMS & mobile based reporting app that the [CascadiaJS](http://2015.cascadiajs.com) conference used.

## We try and work with speakers

Knowing that you aren’t going to be left on your own to make your talk a success hopefully makes presenting a lot less intimidating, and therefore opens the opportunity to many new people.

We have recently started offering speakers the opportunity to do a practice run for the event organisers. Ivanna McConnell took us up on this offer, and briefly mentions the process in [her post about speaking at Type Brigade](http://ivanamcconnell.com/blog/2015/06/15/types-of-fun-reflections-on-speaking-at-typebrigade/).

A lot of the web development conferences I have been involved with or applied to speak at have offered some form of office hours or slide reviews. CascadiaJS had a slack channel with all the organisers and speakers, which was great for sharing tools and 

## Some areas we are not doing well

Special events. We ran two special events and have one upcoming. All the mentors and organisers of these events have been men. This is usually because they have been able to donate their time, cover their travel, or figure out a similar arrangement with us to come and be part of Type Brigade. I think this highlights a larger issue with TypeCon’s model that will inherently skew it towards men: travel and lodging aren’t covered for speakers. I spoke at TypeCon last year, and was lucky enough to have my employer cover the flights, and was able to split a room with someone who I already knew was going.

## In regards to TypeCon

This discussion comes from a place of caring. TypeCon is a dramatically more diverse conference than many, especially when compared to a lot tech conferences. As 


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As an attendee, the atmosphere of <a href="https://twitter.com/typecon">@typecon</a> is very inclusive. Other tech con I get overlooked because of gender, ethnicity, and height.</p>&mdash; theresa dela cruz (@theresadelacruz) <a href="https://twitter.com/theresadelacruz/status/624334463107862528">July 23, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But we can still be critical. People can (and should) be critical of Type Brigade. We value critiques in our work, and they should exist in our conferences too.
