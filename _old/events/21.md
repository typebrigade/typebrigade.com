# 20

Hi, I’m Kenneth.

“I find, if you speak about anything for long enough, it always comes back to type,” Peter who’s here with us tonight, quipped in one of our typography classes.

Type enthusiasts like us are always finding excuses to talk about type—so there’s not reason we can just speak about it sooner.

This is Type Brigade number twenty-one.

Our name is an commitment to focusing on both type design and typography:

1. We cover type design and typography
2. We’re a speaker series

## We cover type design and typography

We’re here to learn, and bring the type and design community in Vancouver a little closer together, whether you’re a type designer with a lifetime of experience or just realised you have an interest in letters.

We’re making some progress there, we got a shout-out from Jessica Hische recently.

> Vancouver posted their type meetup on the Type Directors switchboard. Do you have a type meetup in your town? Post it!

Now, she was also promoting this side-project of hers, but if you interpret the quote the right way…

Vancouver posted *their* type meetup… do *you* have a type meetup in your town?”

Nah, didn’t think so, you’re not like Vancouver.

![Jessica H. certified!](#)

That was dumb. Anyway, please don’t tweet that. Do, however, tweet @typebrigade or hash-tag your instagram photos with typebrigade if you’re into that kind of thing

What were we talking about? Oh, right. What is Type Brigade. Okay, equally committed to type, letters, and their implementation.

## We’re a speaker series

And two, we are a _brigade_ format speaker series, like our sibling meetups [CSS Brigade](http://cssbrigade.com) and [Node Brigade](http://meetup.com/node-brigade-vancouver).

This means we’ll have a 25–30 minutes talk, followed by a brief Q&A with the speaker, when you can ask any questions you through of during the talk. After that, we’ll have a quick break. The second talk and Q&A will be next. And finally if there’s interest, everyone’s welcome to grab a drink and food together nearby. That’s Type Brigade.

## Speakers

You’re going to see two amazing speakers tonight.

First, Alanna Munro will speak to us about local lettering. If you’ve ever creepily stood outside someone’s apartment building admiring the golden lettering, then Alanna’s talk is for you.

Brooke Allen is our second speaker. She has over nine years of experience as a design educator and for her Masters degree she explored the history of typesetting across various media.

You’ll hear more about and from them momentarily.

## Numerals

We’re super excited to share Type Brigade’s event numerals, which were tiled as you entered. They’re designed by our assistant organiser this meetup’s resident letterer Riley Cran.

Riley made some clever references to both talks in this mark, and I’m really proud we get to call them ours for this meetup and the next little while.

## Team

In addition to Andrea, the other people working on the event today are:

- Cody Jones, Assistant Organiser
- Andrea Husky, Assistant Organiser
- Jorge, Mentor via CSS Brigade
- Also me, hi.

## Code of Conduct

It’s heavily based on prior work of people we admire, and we value it because it will keeps us trying to make our events as welcoming as possible.

We like to summarise it as follows:

> Be kind to others, and don't be a jerk.

I think we can all get on board with that anyway, but having it explicitly outlined just makes expectations clear. The full code is on the website, it’s open source, and other meetups are welcome repurpose it as we have.

If something happens that makes you feel uncomfortable, please see or contact Andrea or me. We are friendly, happy to help and listen, and will take your concerns seriously.

## Sponsors

We wouldn’t have much to say about anything without our super cool sponsors, however, because Type Brigade wouldn’t be here! I can happily say all these companies care about type and design, and I would share them with you anyway.

### Chloi Inc.

Chloi is sponsoring organisational overhead and beer! [Clap]

Your latest project is going awesome, but you need a development team with an expertise in mobile and JavaScript, you should talk to me after. I work at Chloi, and we’re software engineers that love working with designers and other studios.

### Mobify

Our next sponsor is Mobify, thanks to them for letting us use their wonderful headquarters! [Clap]

Hiring?

### Louder Than Ten

[Clap]

- Successfully navigating client relationships and project management is key to getting to do the parts of your job you love
- Louder Than Ten

They have training programs, weekly screencasts, and an event coming up at VFS, all of which is on their website at louderthanten.com

## Type Brigade

This is the best part, where you don’t have to listen to me talk anymore. Let me introduce you to our first speaker Alanna Munro, and we’ll get started.
