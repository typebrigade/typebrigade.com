## Bruno Maag Talks Type

Since 1991, Dalton Maag has worked closely with clients including BMW, Intel, Nokia, and many more to develop custom typefaces for complex situations. They are now one of the largest independent type design studios in Europe. They also publish a wide range of typefaces of their own, like [Effra](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/effra), [Prometo](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/prometo), and [Grueber](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/grueber).

We are incredibly lucky to have Bruno Maag coming all the way from London to share his wealth of type, design, and business experience with us.

See you on March 26<sup>th</sup> for [Bruno Maag Talks Type](http://bruno-maag-talks-type.eventbrite.com/).
