# Commercial Type at Type Brigade

Paul Barnes & Christian Schwartz of Commercial Type, the highly respected, New York-based type design studio, kick-off their North American tour in Vancouver.

## It’s not just about the money, it’s not just about the art.
Five years of Commercial Type.

> For the past five years Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz have been running one of the most exciting and influential type foundries, Commercial Type, with offices in New York and London. They have managed to create both popular and critically acclaimed typefaces for a diverse range of organisations, from the Guardian Newspaper, Vanity Fair magazine, to shirt numbers for Puma at the FIFA 2010 World Cup. Their designs vary from the utilitarian Graphik and Stag, through to the playful and expressive Dala Floda and Marian. They will talk about the processes behind their designs, balancing the needs for expression, self expression and functionalism.
