# Our number twenty

[Tomorrow evening](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade/events/186884552/) is our twentieth meetup, and the first under our new name _Type Brigade_. In addition to the new name, we’ve been planning something  a little unconventional that we just couldn’t wait until then to share.

Below are __our completely custom event numerals__, designed by Type Brigade’s Assistant Organiser & Resident Letterer [Andrea Husky](http://instagram.com/andreahusky) for tomorrow’s meetup:

Andrea is cleverly referencing [Modern №20](http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/298/modern-no-20) by [Ed Benguiat](http://typedia.com/explore/designer/ed-benguiat/) for Type Brigade №20, and the result is these fantastic Didone numerals we’re proud to call our own.

Modern №20 has certainly been used in [a wide range of places](http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/298/modern-no-20), from the cover of a 70s board game to the visual identity the largest independent design consultancy in the world.

When asked about Pentagram’s visual identity, Michael Bierut offered a simple history:

> just the name written in the typeface Modern №20. The original five partners used the typeface in the book they published in 1972 when the firm was founded, and I think it was simply adopted as the standard way of writing the name thereafter.

The italic, less commonly used in identity work than the roman, has been captured in FontShop’s specimens:

Andrea shared some of her process from the numerals, too. You should [follow her on Instagram](http://instagram.com/andreahusky) to see more of her fantastic lettering in progress.

Type Brigade’s [team](../about) and I are hoping to make this meetup unique, and type history and our event numerals are going to be a big part of that.
