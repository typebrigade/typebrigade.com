# Year of the em dash

# Year of Dashes

2014 was the year of the em dash—at least, that’s what we decided, as the Unicode entity for the em dash is `U+2014`. Half-way through this typographically significant year, we relaunched the Vancouver Typography Meetup Group as [Type Brigade](http://meetup.com/typebrigade), a community speaker series and meetup, focused on lettering, typography, and type design.

## May

In May, we relaunched the Vancouver Typography Meetup Group as [Type Brigade](http://meetup.com/typebrigade) and started open sourcing our materials along the way, like this site itself.

Vancouver Design Week

For Vancouver Design Week, we ran our first paid event, allowing us to host [20] attendees.

Leading the workshop is [Ross Milne of Working Format](http://workingformat.com). Ross studied type design at the internationally acclaimed Type & Media masters course at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK), and is a contributing designer with Commercial Type in New York, and Typotheque in the Hague, Netherlands.

We were very lucky to have him teach us about the relationship between tools and letterforms. [Chloi, where I work](http://chloi.io), had kindly offered up our space, and we went on to create this installation using takeout boxes.

After that, [Christian Dahlberg of Vancouver Neon](http://vancouverneon.com) lead us on the Type Walk down Granville Street, giving us a glimpse into the history and craft around neon signs and sign making.
