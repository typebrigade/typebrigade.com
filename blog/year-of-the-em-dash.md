# Year of the em dash

2014 was the year of the em dash—at least, that’s what we decided, as the Unicode entity for the em dash is `U+2014`. Half-way through this typographically significant year, we relaunched the Vancouver Typography Meetup Group as [Type Brigade](http://meetup.com/typebrigade), a community speaker series committed to typography type design.
