# 20

Hi, I’m Kenneth.

“I find, if you speak about anything for long enough, it always comes back to type,” Peter who’s here with us tonight, quipped in one of our typography classes.

Type enthusiasts like us are always finding excuses to talk about type—so there’s not reason we can just speak about it sooner.

This is Type Brigade number twenty-one.

Our name is an commitment to focusing on both type design and typography:

1. We cover type design and typography
2. We’re a speaker series

## We cover type design and typography

We’re here to learn, and bring the type and design community in Vancouver a little closer together, whether you’re a type designer with a lifetime of experience or just realised you have an interest in letters.

We’re making some progress there, we got a shout-out from Jessica Hische recently.

> Vancouver posted their type meetup on the Type Directors switchboard. Do you have a type meetup in your town? Post it!

Now, she was also promoting this side-project of hers, but if you interpret the quote the right way…

Vancouver posted *their* type meetup… do *you* have a type meetup in your town?”

Nah, didn’t think so, you’re not like Vancouver.

![Jessica H. certified!](#)

That was dumb. Anyway, please don’t tweet that. Do, however, tweet @typebrigade or hash-tag your instagram photos with typebrigade if you’re into that kind of thing

What were we talking about? Oh, right. What is Type Brigade. Okay, equally committed to type, letters, and their implementation.

## We’re a speaker series

And two, we are a _brigade_ format speaker series, like our sibling meetups [CSS Brigade](http://cssbrigade.com) and [Node Brigade](http://meetup.com/node-brigade-vancouver).

This means we’ll have a 25–30 minutes talk, followed by a brief Q&A with the speaker, when you can ask any questions you through of during the talk. After that, we’ll have a quick break. The second talk and Q&A will be next. And finally if there’s interest, everyone’s welcome to grab a drink and food together nearby. That’s Type Brigade.

## Speakers 

You’re going to see two amazing speakers tonight.

First, Alanna Munro will speak to us about local lettering. If you’ve ever creepily stood outside someone’s apartment building admiring the golden lettering, then Alanna’s talk is for you.

Brooke Allen is our second speaker. She has over nine years of experience as a design educator and for her Masters degree she explored the history of typesetting across various media.

You’ll hear more about and from them momentarily.

## Numerals

We’re super excited to share Type Brigade’s event numerals, which were tiled as you entered. They’re designed by our assistant organiser this meetup’s resident letterer Riley Cran.

Riley made some clever references to both talks in this mark, and I’m really proud we get to call them ours for this meetup and the next little while.

## Team

In addition to Andrea, the other people working on the event today are:

- Cody Jones, Assistant Organiser
- Andrea Husky, Assistant Organiser
- Jorge, Mentor via CSS Brigade
- Also me, hi.

## Code of Conduct

It’s heavily based on prior work of people we admire, and we value it because it will keeps us trying to make our events as welcoming as possible.

We like to summarise it as follows:

> Be kind to others, and don't be a jerk.

I think we can all get on board with that anyway, but having it explicitly outlined just makes expectations clear. The full code is on the website, it’s open source, and other meetups are welcome repurpose it as we have.

If something happens that makes you feel uncomfortable, please see or contact Andrea or me. We are friendly, happy to help and listen, and will take your concerns seriously.

## Sponsors

We wouldn’t have much to say about anything without our super cool sponsors, however, because Type Brigade wouldn’t be here! I can happily say all these companies care about type and design, and I would share them with you anyway.

### Chloi Inc.

Chloi is sponsoring organisational overhead and beer! [Clap]

Your latest project is going awesome, but you need a development team with an expertise in mobile and JavaScript, you should talk to me after. I work at Chloi, and we’re software engineers that love working with designers and other studios.

### Mobify

Our next sponsor is Mobify, thanks to them for letting us use their wonderful headquarters! [Clap]

Hiring?

### Louder Than Ten

[Clap]

- Successfully navigating client relationships and project management is key to getting to do the parts of your job you love
- Louder Than Ten

They have training programs, weekly screencasts, and an event coming up at VFS, all of which is on their website at louderthanten.com

## Type Brigade

This is the best part, where you don’t have to listen to me talk anymore. Let me introduce you to our first speaker Alanna Munro, and we’ll get started.

## Alanna Munro

Celeste Martin is one of the most effective design instructors my classmates and I have had the pleasure of learning from at Emily Carr University, so I’m really happy she’s here today to present for us. Her attention to detail and expectations us simultaneously strike fear into our hearts and then encourages us to produce work we didn’t know we were capable of.

She specialises in typography, researches at the university’s Social + Interactive Media Centre, and is the editor of their award-winning design research journal Current. Please join me in welcoming Celeste Marin!

## Break

Have a drink if you haven’t already, and feel free to take pictures or tweet about how awesome that talk was. We’re on Instagram and Twitter will keep an eye for your “typebrigade” hashtags and at-mentions

## Neil Kandalgaonkar

Neil Candle-gow-car, or Neil K. for short, is a “hacker and maker of things,” which, while accurate, is a pretty ridiculous understatement. He’s an extremely talented software develope. He’s worked on things you definitely know on the internet: Upcoming, Wikipedia, Flickr, and Google.

Every time I hear Neil speak I learn about some new crazy thing I had no idea he even did, so I guess I shouldn’t have been that surprised when I found out his obsession with type almost sent him down a different career path entirely. Here’s Neil K. on his foray into type design.

## Colophon

Type Brigade’s text and citations are set in Lukasz Dziedzic’s FF More. Headings and quotes are set in Edmondsans by James T. Edmonson, via our friends at Lost Type Co-op, and our custom event numerals are done by our resident letterer Andrea Husky.

### Speakers

We are nothing without our speakers. Massive thank you to Celeste and to Neil for being our first speakers under the new name.

### Team

- Andrea Husky
- Cody Jones
- Riley Cran
- Jorge Pedret

Thank you again to Shelley Gruendler, she was not involved with this particular event but she did found the meetup and we’re very grateful for that.

### Sponsors

Thanks to my friends at Chloi Inc. for making organising this event possible. And our friends at Mobify for letting us use their wonderful headquarters. To the Harp Platform at www.harp.io for covering the the beer and pop. And to Black Sone Press.

## Surprise

Now is an awesome part where we get to show you what they printed for us:

Remember our gorgeous event numerals designed by the talented Andrea Husky? She designed them specifically for this event for a limited edition, letterpress print as a gift from the organisers and Black Stone Press to everyone on the Meetup event list today.

[However we’re giving those away.]

Okay, now close your eyes and imagine your company’s logo is on the screen. And I’m saying things! Lots of nice things to all these great designers!

Okay now you can open your eyes because my email is on here, and that part is important.

We’re hoping to have a new sponsor for beer, and to do another custom print for the next event, but we need one or two very small sponsorships to make that happen. If your company is interested in helping keep this meetup unique, please talk to me after or email me at kenneth@typebrigade.com

## Type Brigade №21

And, that sponsorship slot isn’t actually too far away! Type Brigade 21 will be happening in almost exactly two months, towards the end of August.

Make sure you visit typebrigade.com and join, and tell your type-fanatic friends and you’ll get an email when we announce the exact date.

## Call for Speakers

We’re also excited to announce our Call for Speakers is now open.

We have a simple form and a bunch of useful resources listed on our website.

If you have a talk you’re preparing a type or design for a larger event, we can be a great audience to preview it. If you have an old talk, feel free to reuse or update it, we haven’t got the chance to see it yet! If neither of those apply to you, you might not think of you’re a speaker, but I’d really like the opportunity to prove you wrong.

You don’t need to know everything about type to teach us something, and we’re ready to help mentor if you don’t feel ready yet or your proposal needs some polish. Jorge has been doing this through CSS Brigade and we can help or find you an appropriate mentor, a practice audience, whatever.

## Social

Okay! And as practice for talking more about type, we’ll be heading as a group to Subeez for food and maybe a drink shortly, which is right nearby.

Thanks for coming! That was Type Brigade.
