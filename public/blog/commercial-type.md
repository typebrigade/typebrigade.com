I became more familiar with Commercial Type after reading their interview in Codex #1, which was very influential on me.

In the interview, Christian Scwartz discusses how he and Paul Barnes worked closely with Kai Bernaue, then a recent graduate, improve his typeface, Lyon. Christian went to work with him, and he worked with Commercial Type in person for a month. Christian explained, “We believe that the old foundry system of art direction is a good and productive thing, and we tend to think that type design in isolation is not necessarily a good thing.”

Perhaps part of that philosophy is how we are lucky enough to have Commercial Type here at Type Brigade. This time, we get to be the students for a moment, Here to bring us out of our typographic isolation, please join me in welcoming, Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz.
