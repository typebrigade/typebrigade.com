# Type Camp in March 2016

At Type Brigade №28, we were lucky to have [Type Camp](http://typecamp.com)’s Shelley Gruendler and Xandra Zamora present on their work. In March, they return to Vancouver to host two more Type Camp workshops!

- [Vancouver Blackletter](http://www.typecamp.org/camps/vancouverblackletter/)
- [Vancouver Experimental Lettering](http://www.typecamp.org/camps/vancouver-experimental/)

At the Blackletter Type Camp, you’ll learn…

> how to use the parallel pen, one of the most versatile tools around for broad edge lettering, hone your spacing analysis and techniques which will aid you in writing any other letterform, and develop the skill necessary to write a basic black-letter alphabet.

I’ve attended Type Camp, Shelley’s Web Type West conference, and even this meetup was [originally founded](introducing-type-brigade) by her. If you are interested in type and lettering, want to improve your skills and make your future practice more effective, I highly reccomend signing up for a workshop with Shelley and Xandra while they are in town.

Make sure to let them know Type Brigade sent you in the additional details, and you should still be eligible for the Early Bird price.
