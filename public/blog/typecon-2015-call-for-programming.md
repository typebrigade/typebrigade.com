TypeCon is the annual conference on typography, type design, and related arts. The conference takes place from August 12th to 16th in Denver, Colorado. They have just extended their proposal deadline:

It’s worth noting that they are unable to cover travel or hotel expenses for the conference, but it is certainly worth applying if your employer or someone else might be able to help out. The Type Brigade team would still like to encourage our previous speakers to apply. If you are accepted, get in touch with us and we’ll do our best to try and help find some additional sponsorship for your trip there.
