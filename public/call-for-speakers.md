# Call for Speakers

Type Brigade is now accepting presentation proposals for future events.

Whether you’re an experienced type designer with a talk you’ve given before, or have recently become interested in typography and are still working on your idea, we welcome your proposal. We firmly believe you have something worthwhile to share, and you certainly don’t need to know everything type to teach us something.

> The response was very enthusiastic. I’m very glad I did this, as I’m way out of practice at public speaking, but I’m told I did really well. I tried to imagine the audience as a large group of new friends, which seemed to work.

## Format

Type Brigade hosts two speakers per meetup. Each presents for 25–30 minutes, with audience questions held until a 5 minute <abbr>Q&A</abbr> session afterwards. There’s a brief intermission between the talks. After both, attendees usually relocate as a group to a nearby bar.

We’re open to straying from this format, however. Feel free to send us your idea even if it doesn’t fit into this framework!

## Topics

This meetup recognises the importance of type at any stage of its development or use. Whether your talk focuses on the historical design of a alternate character in a non-Latin language, or looks at typography in user interfaces across a wide range of popular mobile devices—if it’s about type, chances are you’ll fit right in. Some examples of topics explored at previous events:

- Typography in interactive ebooks
- Type and architecture
- Wayfinding signage in airports
- [Local Lettering in Vancouver](http://locallettering.com)

## We Can Help

You may not see yourself as a speaker, but Type Brigade would like to help you change this. Not everyone has experience presenting to an audience. Not everyone has experience designing slides. Not everyone realises they have something great to talk about.

- We can assist in brainstorming ideas
- We can connect your with experienced speakers to help you prepare your submission
- We can recommendation tools to produce slides, or review what you have so far
- We can put together a small, friendly audience for you to practice in front of
- We will do our best to help with other requests, just email [kenneth@typebrigade.com](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com).

Make sure you take a look at Tiffany Conroy’s site, [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me). It’s written towards developers considering speaking at programming events, but it is filled with great resources for anyone who has something worthwhile to share. (That’s you!)

## Perks

Type Brigade offers

- An audience of type fans and members of Vancouver’s design community, enthusiastic about your project or story
- The chance to practice your talk for real before taking it to a larger conference


## Example Submission

__Presentation title__ Efficient Web Type, c. 1556

__Abstract__ It’s 1556, and Pierre Haultin is finishing punching a metal letter for a completely impractical book: space-efficient typographically, but far too small to read. He intentionally looked for limits—we’re still facing dilemmas of typographic efficiency centuries later. The experience of the web is affected visual and technical performance of fonts. This talk introduces the best practices and practical improvements WOFF (Web Open Font Format) 2.0 support will bring to designers and developers, and what problems we will still have to solve ourselves.
