      "abstract": "For now, Ross Milne’s new typefaces Charlie & Echo are done. Recently release through the Typotheque, with support for over 140 languages across Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts, eleven weights with corresponding italics, numerous figure styles, expanded icons, arrows and too many currency symbols to count, it’s fair to say that Charlie has grown bigger than ever envisioned. He’ll share some of the process in getting to that point at Type Brigade №24."

      "abstract": "Looking back historically at type as a form of branding and voice, the cult typography of the Harlequin Romance novel will be revived in conversation. Topics such as myth, desire, fantasy and projection will serve as a basis to reflect on the collaborative and research based project Ingrid and Emma undertook for their photo and text based Harlequin Novel project Paradise Passes Through Here. By mimicking the poetic affectiveness of the pulp aesthetic, a connection will be drawn in relation to the politics of Feminist discourse and it's recognition in conceptual art."
