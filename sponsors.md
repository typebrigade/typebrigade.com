# Sponsors

Type Brigade is Vancouver, Canada’s typography and type design speaker series meetup, running every other month. We have a mailing list of over 500 talented and curious communication designers, visual artists, web developers, and type fans, ready for an inclusive evening of learning about typography and design.

## Open Sponsorship

We have one sponsorship spot left for $250 our next event, which will be used to make a selection of beer and sodas available for free to attendees during the event. If you’re interested in signing up to sponsor three or more events, we can offer a discount.

If you are:

- Interested in finding designers in Vancouver to __hire__
- Building a __product__ for people who use design and media tools
- A studio or agency looking to become more well __known__ in Vancouver, and want to help growing the design community here

…sponsoring Type Brigade is an easy and inexpensive way to help while supporting a well-recieved local event.
