# About Type Brigade

Type Brigade is Vancouver’s type speaker series. We organise about 6 events a year on typography, type design, lettering, and other subjects through the lens of letters. We find, if you speak about anything for long enough, it always comes back to type—all the more reason to speak about it sooner.

[Our amazing patrons on Patreon](https://patreon.com/typebrigade) help make Type Brigade events possible. Back us on Patreon to receive special perks, like reserved seats at our free events.
