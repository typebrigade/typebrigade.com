Type Brigade is [Vancouver’s type design and typography meetup](http://meetup.com/typebrigade), where we host speakers every other month. This [Type Walk](http://walk.typebrigade.com) is an off-month special event to coincide with Vancouver Design Week.

## The Workshop

_6:00–8:00PM_

The first portion of the evening will be a workshop hosted by [Ross Milne of Working Format](http://workingformat.com). Ross studied type design at the internationally acclaimed Type & Media masters course at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK), is a contributing designer with Commercial Type in New York, and with Typotheque in the Hague, Netherlands.

## About Vancouver Design Week

Among other things, Vancouver Design Week is looking to

> cross-pollenate and empower designers and design-thinkers across disciplines … in Vancouver, and beyond.
> **Vancouver Design Week**

This is something particularly important to us with Type Brigade. Type has a place in most disciplines, and is a great way to start conversations about design.

## Type Walk

Hope to see you on September 26<sup>th</sup>!
