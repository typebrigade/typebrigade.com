[Type Brigade №26](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade/events/222545955/) is June 4th, making it one year since we relaunched Vancouver’s typography meetup as [Type Brigade](introducing-type-brigade). I’m very excited to welcome one Type Brigade regular and one newcomer to present at our next event: Travis Gertz & Ivana McConnell!

## Our speakers

[Travis Gertz](https://twitter.com/travisgertz) is the co-founder of [Louder Than Ten](http://louderthanten.com/), the school for freelancers and teams managing design projects. He has a knack for translating what’s great about traditional publication designs to a more appropriate format on the web. At Type Brigade №26, he’ll show us a new kind of breakpoint.

[Ivana McConnell](https://twitter.com/ivanamcconnell) is an interaction designer in Vancouver, making things at [Myplanet](https://www.myplanet.com/). She’ll show us the larger cultural impact typographic decisions can create—flashpoints, where typography was more powerful than we gave it credit for.

## Our custom numeral

Another thing important to us are our custom event numerals. Every Type Brigade is represented by a new piece of lettering.
