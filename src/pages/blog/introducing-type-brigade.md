# Introducing Type Brigade

During a lecture a few months back, designer Peter Cocking quipped “I find, if you speak about anything for long enough, **it always comes back to type**.”

All the more reason to speak about it sooner.

I’m excited to announce the [Vancouver Typography Meetup Group](http://meetup.com/vancouver-typography-meetup-group) is now **Type Brigade**. Our first event with our new name—the group’s 20<sup>th</sup> event—will be on June 24th at [Mobify HQ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/948+Homer+St/@49.2780571,-123.119061,17z). That’s one floor below where Bringhurst’s classic _The Elements of Typographic Style_ was published. [Register for **Type Brigade** here.](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade/events/186884552/)

Why the name **Type Brigade**? It signals a change in format: two talks, 25 minutes each, followed by a five minute Q&A. It’s free to attend. Additionally, it’s a commitment to focusing on type design as much as typography.

Shelley Gruendler originally created this meetup, and she continues to create amazing opportunities for type designers and typographers—[in Vancouver](http://www.typecamp.org/camps/vancouver-pointed-pen) and [further away from home](http://www.typecamp.org/incredible-india-2014). I want to thank her for all the time she has invested into getting this meetup where it is, and her go-ahead to move it in a new direction.

I’m really looking forward to meeting you and—whether you’ve been to an event yet or not—sharing what we have planned.

See you at [Type Brigade №20](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade/events/186884552/) on June 24<sup>th</sup>!
