# The Call for Speakers is open

Type Brigade is a chance for Vancouver’s typography and type design community to get together. Now, it’s an opportunity for those same people to share.

We’re excited to announce that Type Brigade’s [Call for Speakers](../call-for-speakers) is **now open**. We’re lucky to have two fantastic speakers lined up for the [next event](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade/events/186884552/), and are actively seeking speakers for a subsequent meetups.

Take a look at the [Call for Speakers](../call-for-speakers) for all the information and feel to mention [@typebrigade on Twitter](http://twitter.com/typebrigade) if you have any questions.
