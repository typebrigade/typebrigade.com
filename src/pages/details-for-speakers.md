# Details for Speakers

Thanks so much for becoming a **Type Brigade** speaker! Foremost, our goal is to remove any concerns you have around the event, so you can just focus on presenting. So: if you have any questions or concerns, [please email me](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com) anytime.

You can register for [Type Brigade at meetup.com/typebrigade](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade), if you haven’t already. Then, you’ll get an email when we publicly announce the event.

## Your talk

We have more details on the format of the talks on the [Call for Speakers](http://typebrigade.com/call-for-speakers) page. In short, you have a 25–30 minute speaking slot followed by a 5 minute Q&A.

To help us promote it, please fill out some details about your presentation for us—it doesn’t have to be perfect or finalised, just enough so we can announce the event.


<strong><a href="https://typebrigade.wufoo.com/forms/m1uocne51azfrmy/" target="_blank">Please fill out the form here.</a></strong>

More details about what to expect as a speaker are below.

### Slides

We should be able to accommodate any standard slide resolution, but the optimal one for the projector is 1920×1080.

We prefer if speakers [send Kenneth slides](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com) the day before the event if possible. He’ll set them up on his computer, so they’re already ready for you at the venue. This way, we don’t have to find additional cables or connectors and don’t have to change anything over between talks. Formats we’ve used without trouble:

- PDF
- Keynote (latest and ‘09)
- Anything web based (Slid.es, Google Docs, etc.)

We don’t use mirrored displays, so you can use speaker notes if you’d like. If you have another format, just let us know and we’ll do our best to accommodate it. You are also welcome to present using your own computer, but please make sure to arrive with enough time for us to test your machine with the projectors.

### Other equipment

We will also have the following equipment available:

- One remote control with your slides
- Two microphones

## Code of Conduct

We maintain a [Code of Conduct](http://typebrigade.com/code-of-conduct) for Type Brigade, which establishes expectations for all organisers, speakers, sponsors, and attendees. It’s a continuous work in progress, with the goal of ensuring Type Brigade is a safe and welcoming community event with clearly established anti-harassment and anti-intimidation considerations.

It’s a record based upon on the work of other events we admire. Running a safe and welcoming event is something we take very seriously, so if you have any positive or negative comments on the Code of Conduct or our approach in general, please let either [Kenneth](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com) or [Alanna](mailto:alanna@typebrigade.com) know.

## Attendees

After a long hiatus, we are not sure what our attendance numbers will look like in 2024 and onwards. We’re fairly optimistic we will have 50–75 attendees for our upcoming events.

Our audience is about one half professional and student graphic and interaction designers, a smaller group of aspiring type designers and letterers, and the remainder work outside of the industry but have a strong interest in typography.

If you’re interested, you can also see [our full member list](http://www.meetup.com/typebrigade/members/) to get a sense of who will be there.

### Promotion

If there’s anything you’d like us to promote at the event on your behalf (a specific blog you maintain, a product you work on, your freelance work, etc.) we’d be more than happy to do what we can. Just email [Kenneth](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com) with any details.

Any on-going promotion you’re willing to help us out with attendance, like emailing or sharing the event with your own followers, telling co-workers, listing your talk with us on your site, etc. is always appreciated.

## Questions?

As always, if you have any questions, just email [Kenneth](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com). Thanks again for being part of Type Brigade.
