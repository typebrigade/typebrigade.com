# Sponsors

Type Brigade is Vancouver’s typography meetup. We’ve been getting together since 2011, and now have well over 1,500 talented and curious designers, artists, developers, and type fans, ready to meet and learn about typography, design, and anything connected to it.

The current organising team has been running speaker series events and workshops since 2014.
